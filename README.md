## Project Motivation
Scenario : As a Data Science Manager at Amazon, I was tasked to build a recommendation system that could enhance the user experience by suggesting products based on their previous ratings. 

## File Descriptions
The repository contains the following file:
- `Amazon_Product_Recommendation_System.ipynb`: This is the Jupyter Notebook where all the work is done, which includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Results
We compared different models and found that the optimized Matrix Factorization model-based collaborative filtering (svd_optimized) stood out as a strong performer, offering accurate and personalized recommendations.
